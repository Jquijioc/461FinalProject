# 461FinalProject: Identification of Aircraft using EfficientNet

### Project Overview
In this project, we used EfficientNet to identify military aircraft. Identification of military aircraft plays an important role in modern day defense. Especially in modern times, where the chaotic events seen in Ukraine and other places necessitates aircraft identification when the only sources for analysis come from video and images taken from phones or drones since they are the only gear available in the field. Our Goal was to develop a model capable of identifying a wide range of military aircraft from a multitude of countries.

### Features
* **EfficientNet Models**: Utilization of pretrained EfficientNetB3 to classify aircraft
* **Heatmap Visualization**: Utilized Heatmaps for images so users can see what the model was "looking at," using Grad-CAM



### Example Aircraft Prediction:
Here is an example of the model prediction and the actual aircraft used:
